# Healthy Life Style
Introducing my latest project - a simple yet powerful healthy lifestyle application built using Pug, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. This website is designed to help users maintain a healthy lifestyle by providing them with useful information on different exercises, calculating their BMI, and estimating their daily caloric intake. To accomplish this, the website leverages the power of two APIs, which allows users to access a wealth of information on various exercises, as well as easily calculate their BMI and calorie requirements. Whether you're looking to build muscle, lose weight, or simply stay healthy, this application is the perfect tool to help you achieve your fitness goals. So why wait? Check out my repo to learn more and start your journey to a healthier, happier you today!
